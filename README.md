> but do you have any development experience?

After 10 years of system design, and development, working with customers across multiple industries, to see products through multiple iterations of vision to production, I had developed a series of proven, semi-automated, processes which guaranteed successful products, happy customers, and fast and reliable data systems, that were able to predict demand, and deliver business success; I found myself in an interview being faced with the statement: "I can see you have been a tester, but do you have any development experience?".

10 years of developing a process for developing rock solid platforms, and I had been labelled "just a tester".

It has taken me 5 years of working for multiple organizations in various industries, some with good practices, some with bad, most with a mixture of both, to realize what the misunderstanding was:

> Writing code is easy, getting it right is hard

Good developers don't just create something and then hand it over to a user or an intern for testing; The really good developers adopt processes that reduce errors right from the get-go to help people avoid mistakes. Writing code is easy, getting it right is hard.

It is my intent to offer an entry level guide to what testing and validation is, why it is important, and what it means to a technical project. It is my intent to get small teams from zero to testing in as short a time as possible with as few barriers as possible; to give them a foundation on which to build.
