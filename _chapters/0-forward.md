Three months after writing this essay, I started a new position with 
a governmental organization. Across from me sat a very clever fellow 
whose role fell somewhere in project lead, software developer, or 
team coach. On the surface, his PhD in microbiology made him an odd 
fit for direct work on a government license tracking system, but it 
was one of those vague areas of expertise that comes from having a 
wide range of skills that allows you to see through all the buzz 
words and jargon to the underlying issues that hit all projects, 
teams, and problems. 

During one of our morning chats, I almost snorted my coffee when he 
began a rant with a statement to the effect of: "I come from a 
scientific background, and I don't understand why we don't validate 
our work as much as we should. How are we supposed to *know*. Its 
basic scientific method."

Two years later, I decided to share the essay. A basic website, on a 
standard website publishing platform (Google Sites): nothing fancy. I 
nearly snorted my coffee again when I see the default populated 
sample content:

Again, the theme of needing to "know" arises, first from Feynman, 
then from whatever group of Google developers felt the need to quote 
him. 

I can imagine the frustration those designers or developers or 
whatever role they were were feeling the day they selected those two 
quotes to best express their desire for change. I can personally 
empathize with their feelings. It is the same sense of frustration 
that my colleague was expressing, the same sense of frustration 
expressed over and over again by managers, and employees, within the 
software industry. 

Compounding the frustration is the  the same sense of frustration you 
feel when you realize that there have been effective solutions to the 
problem for
